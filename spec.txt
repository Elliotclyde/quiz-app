What should happen in the actual quiz page??

First the person who made the quiz needs to host it:

So first it needs to check: 
    -Is there a quiz already going? 
    -Does this quiz exist
    -Is there a localstorage user ID? 
    -Does that ID match the creator of the quiz? 

    -IF no to 1 but yes to the other 3 no then:

Then it goes into "Waiting room" mode 

    -This shows the link to invite your friends in  
    -The host waits for people to join and the server pushes to the client when other people have joined 
    -When enought people have joined the host can click "start quiz"

Then it goes into quiz mode

    -Only shows one question at a time 
    -When they answer the host (and potentially later the other players) gets notified they answered (and notified about whether they got it right)
    -After all the players have answered, the quiz moves to the next question
